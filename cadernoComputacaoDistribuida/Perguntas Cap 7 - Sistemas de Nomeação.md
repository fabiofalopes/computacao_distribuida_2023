1. **O que são nomes e identificadores num serviço de nomes?**
   Nomes são designações independentes do sistema, geralmente em formato textual, usadas para identificar recursos num ambiente distribuído, como ficheiros, serviços e objetos. Identificadores são referências internas do sistema, como um formato binário, que são associadas a esses nomes para permitir a localização dos recursos.
   
   Em um serviço de nomes, os nomes são usados para identificar recursos, como hosts, dispositivos de rede, serviços e outros objetos em um ambiente distribuído. Os nomes são geralmente organizados em uma hierarquia, com cada nível da hierarquia representando um domínio ou subdomínio.
   
   Os identificadores, por outro lado, são usados para identificar exclusivamente um recurso em um ambiente distribuído. Eles são frequentemente usados em conjunto com nomes para fornecer uma identificação única para um recurso específico.
   
   Por exemplo, em um serviço de nomes DNS, um nome pode ser "www.example.com", que identifica um servidor web em um domínio específico. O identificador pode ser o endereço IP exclusivo do servidor, que é usado para identificar exclusivamente o servidor na rede.

2. **O que são as operações Bind e Lookup num serviço de nomes?**
   As operações Bind e Lookup são duas operações fundamentais em um serviço de nomes.
   
   As operações associadas à nomeação:
- Bind: cria uma associação entre um nome e uma referência para os atributos do recurso;
- Lookup: permite realizar a resolução do nome;

   
   A operação Bind é usada para associar um nome a um identificador em um serviço de nomes. Isso é feito inserindo um par de valores (nome, identificador) na tabela de associação de nomes do serviço de nomes. Por exemplo, em um serviço de nomes DNS, a operação Bind é usada para associar um nome de domínio a um endereço IP.
   
   A operação Lookup, por outro lado, é usada para pesquisar um nome em um serviço de nomes e obter o identificador associado a ele. Isso é feito consultando a tabela de associação de nomes do serviço de nomes para encontrar o identificador correspondente ao nome pesquisado. Por exemplo, em um serviço de nomes DNS, a operação Lookup é usada para pesquisar um nome de domínio e obter o endereço IP correspondente.

# Duvida: Os nomes hierárquicos são puros ou impuros?
3. **O que são nomes puros e impuros? Os nomes hierárquicos são puros ou impuros?**
   Nomes puros e impuros são conceitos relacionados à presença ou ausência de informações sobre a localização do objeto no próprio nome.

- Nomes puros: São nomes que não contêm informações sobre a localização do objeto. Eles não ajudam na localização do objeto e não precisam ser alterados se o objeto mudar de localização. Um exemplo comum de nomes puros são os nomes de domínio no DNS, que não contêm informações sobre a localização dos servidores.

- Nomes impuros: São nomes que contêm informações sobre a localização do objeto. Eles facilitam a localização do objeto dado o seu nome, mas precisam ser alterados se o objeto mudar de localização. Um exemplo de nome impuro seria um URL completo que inclui o protocolo, o nome do servidor e o caminho completo para o recurso.

4. **Quais são os serviços de nomes necessários para resolver um URL?**
   Para resolver um URL (Uniform Resource Locator), vários serviços de nomes podem ser necessários, dependendo do tipo de URL e do ambiente em que está sendo resolvido. Alguns dos serviços de nomes que podem ser necessários incluem:

1. Serviço de Nomes de Domínio (DNS): O DNS é fundamental para resolver nomes de domínio em endereços IP. Quando um URL contém um nome de domínio, o sistema de resolução de nomes precisa consultar os servidores DNS para obter o endereço IP associado ao nome de domínio.

2. Serviço de Nomes de Serviços (por exemplo, para resolução de serviços específicos, como RMI, LDAP, etc.): Além do DNS, alguns URLs podem exigir a resolução de serviços específicos, como RMI (Remote Method Invocation) ou LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). Nesses casos, os sistemas de resolução de nomes precisam consultar os serviços de nomes apropriados para obter informações sobre a localização e os detalhes dos serviços específicos associados ao URL.

Esses são exemplos de serviços de nomes que podem ser necessários para resolver um URL em um ambiente distribuído e dependem do tipo de URL e dos recursos específicos associados a ele.

5. **O que é aliasing?**
   Aliasing é um conceito em serviços de nomes que se refere à capacidade de associar vários nomes a um único recurso. Isso é útil em ambientes distribuídos, onde um recurso pode ser acessado por vários nomes diferentes.
   
   Por exemplo, em um serviço de nomes DNS, um servidor web pode ser acessado por vários nomes de domínio diferentes, como "www.example.com" e "example.com". Ambos os nomes podem ser associados ao mesmo endereço IP do servidor web, permitindo que o recurso seja acessado por vários nomes diferentes.
   
   O aliasing é útil porque permite que os recursos sejam acessados de várias maneiras diferentes, o que pode ser conveniente para os usuários e pode ajudar a distribuir a carga de tráfego em uma rede. No entanto, é importante garantir que a associação de nomes seja gerenciada corretamente para evitar conflitos e garantir a consistência dos dados.

6. **O que faz a operação de mount em espaços de nomes?**
   A resolução de nomes iterativa é um processo onde o cliente solicita a resolução de cada parte do nome de domínio a diferentes servidores de nomes, um passo de cada vez. A resolução recursiva é quando o cliente faz uma única solicitação a um servidor de nomes, que por sua vez realiza todas as consultas necessárias para resolver o nome completo, retornando o resultado final ao cliente.
   
   Quando um sistema de arquivos remoto é montado num sistema local, os arquivos e diretorias do sistema remoto tornam-se parte do espaço de nomes do sistema local. Isso significa que os programas e usuários podem aceder esses arquivos e diretorias usando caminhos de arquivo locais, como se estivessem armazenados localmente.
   
   A operação de mount é essencial para a construção de sistemas de arquivos distribuídos, pois permite a integração transparente de recursos de armazenamento remoto no ambiente de armazenamento local. Ela desempenha um papel crucial na criação de ambientes distribuídos coesos e na facilitação do acesso a recursos remotos como se fossem recursos locais .

## **Página 44**

1. **O que é a resolução de nomes iterativa e recursiva?**
   Resolução iterativa: o cliente faz consultas sucessivas aos servidores de nomes, passando de um nível hierárquico para o próximo, até obter a resposta desejada. Cada componente do nome é apresentado ao servidor do contexto de topo (TLD), e o processo continua no contexto do componente seguinte.
   
   Resolução recursiva: o servidor de nomes consultado pelo cliente é responsável por obter a resposta completa, interagindo com outros servidores, se necessário, para resolver o nome por completo. O servidor de nomes pode interagir de forma iterativa ou recursiva com outros servidores para resolver o nome.

2. **Porque é que o caching funciona bem nos serviços de nomes?**
   O caching funciona bem nos serviços de nomes devido à sua capacidade de melhorar o desempenho e reduzir a latência no acesso a informações de resolução de nomes. Quando um cliente realiza uma consulta de resolução de nomes, os resultados podem ser armazenados em cache localmente. Isso significa que consultas futuras para o mesmo nome podem ser respondidas diretamente a partir do cache, evitando a necessidade de consultar servidores de nomes remotos repetidamente. 
   Além disso, o caching ajuda a reduzir o tráfego na rede, uma vez que as consultas recorrentes podem ser atendidas localmente, sem a necessidade de comunicação com servidores remotos. Isso é especialmente útil em ambientes distribuídos, nos quais a eficiência na resolução de nomes é crucial para o desempenho geral do sistema. 
   Portanto, o caching é uma técnica eficaz para melhorar o desempenho, reduzir a latência e minimizar o tráfego de rede nos serviços de nomes, contribuindo para uma experiência mais eficiente e responsiva para os clientes

3. **Que tipos de servidores de nomes existem no DNS e qual a função de cada um?**
   Existem servidores de nomes primários, que mantêm a base de dados autoritativa dos nomes de domínio; servidores de nomes secundários, que mantêm cópias da base de dados do servidor primário; e servidores de caching, que armazenam respostas de consultas anteriores para acelerar a resolução de nomes.No DNS (Sistema de Nomes de Domínio), existem vários tipos de servidores de nomes, cada um desempenhando funções específicas. Os principais tipos de servidores de nomes no DNS são:

1. Servidores de Nomes Raiz (Root Name Servers): São os servidores de nível mais alto na hierarquia do DNS. Eles respondem às consultas de resolução de nomes fornecendo informações sobre os servidores de nomes autoritativos para os TLDs (Domínios de Nível Superior).

2. Servidores de Nomes de Domínio de Nível Superior (TLD Name Servers): Responsáveis por fornecer informações sobre os servidores de nomes autoritativos para os domínios de nível inferior. Por exemplo, os servidores de nomes para os domínios .com, .org, .net, entre outros.

3. Servidores de Nomes Autoritativos (Authoritative Name Servers): São os servidores que contêm informações diretas sobre um domínio específico. Eles são responsáveis por fornecer informações de resolução de nomes para os domínios pelos quais são autoritativos.
	
	Cada tipo de servidor de nomes desempenha um papel crucial no funcionamento do DNS, garantindo que as consultas de resolução de nomes sejam respondidas de forma precisa e eficiente, contribuindo para a integridade e a disponibilidade do sistema de nomes de domínio.

5. **O que é o TTL (time to live) mantido pelos servidores nas suas caches?**
   O TTL (Time to Live) é um parâmetro que define o tempo que um registro de resolução de nomes pode ser mantido em cache antes de expirar. Esse parâmetro é mantido pelos servidores de nomes em suas caches e é usado para determinar por quanto tempo um registro de resolução de nomes pode ser armazenado em cache antes de ser descartado.
   
   O TTL é definido pelo servidor de nomes autoritativo para o registro de resolução de nomes e é incluído na resposta enviada ao servidor de nomes que fez a consulta. O servidor de nomes que recebe a resposta armazena o registro em cache e usa o TTL para determinar por quanto tempo o registro pode ser mantido em cache antes de expirar.
   
   O TTL é importante porque permite que os registros de resolução de nomes sejam armazenados em cache por um período limitado de tempo, garantindo que as informações de resolução de nomes sejam atualizadas regularmente. Isso ajuda a garantir que as consultas de resolução de nomes sejam respondidas com informações precisas e atualizadas, melhorando a eficiência e a confiabilidade do sistema de nomes de domínio.

## 13.1
Describe the advantages of the uniformity of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).  
*Page 584*
```

### 13.1 Advantages of Uniformity of URIs and URLs

Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) provide a standardized way to identify and locate resources on the internet. The uniformity of URIs and URLs offers several advantages, which are crucial for the functionality and the scalability of the World Wide Web and other internet-based services.

#### Standardization and Interoperability

The uniformity of URIs and URLs ensures that different systems can understand and process resource identifiers in a consistent manner. This standardization is essential for interoperability between various internet services, applications, and protocols. Because URIs and URLs follow a well-defined syntax, software developers can create systems that reliably parse and handle these identifiers, facilitating communication and integration across diverse platforms.

#### Resource Identification and Location

URIs serve as a generic set of names for identifying resources, while URLs provide the additional information needed to locate these resources. The distinction between URIs and URLs is important because it allows for the separation of the identity of a resource from the means to access it. This separation is beneficial because a resource can continue to be identified by the same URI even if its location (URL) changes.

#### Ease of Introduction of New Schemes

The uniform syntax of URIs allows for the introduction of new types of resource identifiers, known as URI schemes, without disrupting existing usage. When a new scheme is created, it must conform to the general URI syntax, but it can define its own scheme-specific rules. This flexibility enables the expansion of the types of resources that can be identified and interacted with on the internet.

#### Use in Diverse Contexts

Uniformity allows URIs and URLs to be used in a wide range of contexts. For example, a URI can be used as a hyperlink in a web page, as a namespace in XML, or as an endpoint in web services. The ability to use the same identifier across different applications and services reduces complexity and enhances the user experience.

#### Human-Readable and Meaningful Names

Although URIs and URLs are designed to be processed by computers, they often contain human-readable components that convey meaning about the resource. For example, the URL `http://www.example.com/about` suggests that it leads to an "about" page of a website with the domain `example.com`. This readability is advantageous for users who need to interpret or manually enter web addresses.

#### Decentralized Management

The hierarchical structure of URIs and URLs allows for decentralized management of resources. Different organizations can manage their own namespaces within the global URI space. For instance, an organization can control all URIs under its domain name, while still being part of the larger internet ecosystem.

#### Support for Caching and Replication

The uniformity of URIs and URLs facilitates caching and replication mechanisms. Caches can store resources based on their URLs, and systems can replicate resources across different locations while maintaining the same URI. This improves the performance and reliability of internet services by allowing resources to be served from locations closer to the user or from backup servers in case of failure.

#### Conclusion

The uniformity of URIs and URLs is a foundational aspect of the internet's architecture. It enables the consistent identification and location of resources, supports the integration of diverse services and applications, and provides a mechanism for the decentralized management of information. This uniformity is essential for the scalability, usability, and robustness of the global network of interconnected resources that we rely on daily.

## 13.2
Discuss the problem associated with name services in a distributed system. How can this be solved?  
*Page 585*
```
### 13.2
Name services in distributed systems are crucial for mapping human-readable names to machine-readable information, such as IP addresses. However, they come with several challenges:

1. **Scalability**: As the number of devices and services in a distributed system grows, the name service must efficiently handle an increasing number of names and lookups without performance degradation.

2. **Consistency**: The name service must ensure that changes to the mapping (such as IP address changes) are propagated promptly so that all clients have up-to-date information. Achieving consistency across a distributed architecture can be challenging due to replication and caching.

3. **Fault Tolerance**: The name service must be resilient to failures. If a name server goes down, it should not cripple the entire system.

4. **Security**: The name service must protect against malicious activities, such as spoofing and denial of service attacks, which can mislead the resolution process or make the service unavailable.

5. **Management of the Namespace**: As organizations change over time, the structure of the namespace may need to adapt. This includes accommodating mergers, acquisitions, and reorganizations.

6. **Heterogeneity**: A distributed system may involve different platforms and technologies, and the name service must work uniformly across these diverse environments.

### Solutions to Name Service Challenges:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Using a hierarchical namespace, such as the Domain Name System (DNS), can improve scalability. Hierarchies allow for delegation of authority and distribution of the database across multiple servers.

2. **Replication**: Replicating the naming database across multiple servers can enhance fault tolerance and improve response times by serving requests from geographically closer servers.

3. **Caching**: Caching recently or frequently accessed name resolutions can reduce lookup times and decrease the load on name servers. However, caching strategies must include mechanisms to invalidate outdated entries to maintain consistency.

4. **Consistency Protocols**: Implementing protocols like eventual consistency can help manage the trade-off between absolute consistency and system performance. These protocols ensure that, given enough time without new updates, all replicas will converge to the same state.

5. **Redundancy**: Deploying multiple name servers for each domain and ensuring that there is no single point of failure can increase the robustness of the name service.

6. **Security Measures**: Implementing security measures such as cryptographic authentication of name responses, rate-limiting, and monitoring can help protect against attacks.

7. **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Supporting dynamic changes to the namespace without service interruption can be achieved through techniques like aliasing and symbolic links, which can redirect queries to new locations seamlessly.

8. **Standardization and Protocols**: Adopting standard protocols and interfaces, such as LDAP for directory services, can help manage heterogeneity by providing a uniform way to access naming information across different systems.

By addressing these challenges with a combination of hierarchical structures, replication, caching, consistency protocols, redundancy, security measures, dynamic reconfiguration, and standardization, name services can provide a robust, scalable, and secure mechanism for resource identification in distributed systems.

## 13.3
Explain why a name space is important for a particular name service. What is the advantage of a hierarchic name space?  
*Page 586*
```

### 13.3 Explain why a name space is important for a particular name service. What is the advantage of a hierarchic name space?

A name space is a fundamental concept in the design of a name service, which is a system that maps human-friendly names to system resources or objects, such as IP addresses, files, or services. The name space defines the set of all possible names that can be used within a particular context or domain and outlines the rules for how names can be created, organized, and resolved.

The importance of a name space for a name service lies in several key aspects:

1. **Uniqueness**: A name space ensures that each name within its scope is unique, preventing ambiguity and confusion when identifying resources. This is crucial for a name service as it allows for precise and unambiguous resolution of names to the resources they represent.

2. **Structure**: By providing a structured set of names, a name space allows for the organization of resources in a way that reflects their relationships and hierarchies. This structure can mirror organizational, geographical, or logical relationships, making it easier for users to understand and navigate the system.

3. **Scalability**: A well-designed name space allows a name service to scale by accommodating a large number of names. As the system grows, the name space can be expanded to include new resources without disrupting existing names.

4. **Management and Delegation**: A name space allows for the delegation of naming authority, where different subspaces can be managed by different entities. This is particularly important in distributed systems where different organizations or administrative domains may control different subsets of the name space.

5. **Security**: A name space can incorporate security policies by controlling who can create, modify, or delete names within it. This helps in maintaining the integrity of the name service and protecting against unauthorized changes.

The advantage of a hierarchic name space, in particular, includes:

1. **Logical Organization**: Hierarchical naming reflects natural organizational structures, such as the domain name system (DNS) where names are organized in a tree-like structure with levels representing domains, subdomains, and so on.

2. **Decentralized Management**: Hierarchic name spaces allow for decentralized management and delegation of authority. Each level in the hierarchy can be managed independently, allowing for local control while maintaining global coherence.

3. **Efficient Resolution**: Hierarchical structures enable efficient name resolution processes. When resolving a name, each level of the hierarchy can be resolved independently, often allowing for the use of caching and reducing the number of lookups required across the network.

4. **Namespace Collision Avoidance**: Hierarchic structures reduce the likelihood of name collisions as names are qualified by their path in the hierarchy, allowing for the same leaf name to be used in different branches without conflict.

5. **Intuitive Navigation and Browsing**: Users can navigate and browse hierarchical name spaces in an intuitive manner, moving up or down the hierarchy to find related resources.

In summary, a name space is critical for the operation of a name service as it provides a structured, scalable, and manageable system for naming resources. A hierarchic name space, in particular, offers additional benefits in terms of organization, management, efficiency, and usability, which are essential for large and complex distributed systems.

### 13.4
Describe the heterogeneity of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) name space. What is its cell and junction in this context? Give an example.  
*Page 589*
```

### 13.4 Describe the heterogeneity of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) name space. What is its cell and junction in this context? Give an example.

The Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) name space is designed to be heterogeneous, meaning it can incorporate and manage different types of name spaces within a single unified system. This heterogeneity allows DCE to support a wide variety of naming conventions and structures, which can be particularly useful in large, distributed systems where different applications or services may have their own specific naming requirements.

In the context of DCE, a "cell" is a logical grouping of resources that are administered as a single unit. A cell typically represents an administrative domain and contains resources such as users, machines, and services that are managed together. Each cell has its own name space, which can be managed independently of other cells. The cell provides a scope for names, meaning that names need to be unique only within the cell, not across the entire DCE environment.

A "junction" in DCE is a point in the name space where one name space is linked to another, allowing for the creation of a composite name space from multiple heterogeneous name spaces. Junctions are similar to mount points in file systems, where one file system is mounted onto another, creating a single, navigable directory structure. In DCE, junctions enable the seamless integration of different name spaces, allowing users and applications to navigate across them as if they were a single, coherent name space.

For example, consider a DCE cell for a university's computer science department, with the cell name `/.../cs.university.edu`. Within this cell, there might be a junction called `files`, which links to a file system name space where directories and files are managed. There might also be a junction called `printers`, linking to a name space that manages printer resources. The full DCE name for a file called `thesis.doc` in the `reports` directory might be `/.../cs.university.edu/files/reports/thesis.doc`, and a printer called `color_printer` in the department might be named `/.../cs.university.edu/printers/color_printer`.

The heterogeneity of the DCE name space, with its concept of cells and junctions, provides a flexible and scalable way to manage names in a distributed environment. It allows different administrative domains to maintain their own naming conventions and structures while still participating in a larger, integrated system. This design supports the diverse needs of various applications and services within a distributed computing environment.

### 13.5
Why does NFS employ iterative navigation in the resolution of a file name?  
*Page 591*
```
### 13.5 Why does NFS employ iterative navigation in the resolution of a file name?

The Network File System (NFS) employs iterative navigation in the resolution of a file name primarily due to its design, which is based on a client-server model where the client is responsible for navigating the directory structure to locate a file. This approach has several advantages and reasons for its use:

1. **Statelessness**: NFS is designed to be stateless on the server side. This means that the server does not keep track of the state of client requests. Iterative navigation allows the client to make independent, stateless requests to the server for each component of the file path, which aligns with the stateless nature of NFS.

2. **Simplicity**: Iterative navigation simplifies the design of the NFS server. Since the server does not need to maintain the state of a client's directory traversal, it can handle requests from many clients more efficiently and with less complexity.

3. **Client-side Flexibility**: By placing the responsibility of navigation on the client, NFS allows for more flexibility on the client side. The client can cache directory information and make intelligent decisions about navigation based on its own cache, potentially reducing network traffic and improving performance.

4. **Fault Tolerance**: Iterative navigation can be more fault-tolerant in the face of network or server failures. If a failure occurs during the resolution process, the client can easily retry the last step of the navigation without having to start from the beginning.

5. **Symbolic Links**: NFS supports symbolic links (symlinks), which are references that point to another file or directory in the file system. With iterative navigation, the client can resolve these symlinks locally as it processes each component of the path. This allows the client to handle symlinks in a transparent manner, following them as necessary to resolve the full file path.

6. **Distributed Environment**: In a distributed environment, different components of a file path may reside on different servers. Iterative navigation allows the client to resolve each component of the path potentially across different servers without requiring complex server-side coordination.

7. **Performance Optimization**: Clients can optimize performance by caching the results of directory lookups. When a client iteratively navigates a file path, it can cache the mappings of directory names to their network addresses (inodes). Subsequent lookups for paths within the same directories can use the cached information, avoiding the need to contact the server again.

8. **Scalability**: Iterative navigation is more scalable because it distributes the workload across clients rather than centralizing it on the server. Each client independently resolves the path to a file, which allows the NFS service to scale to handle a large number of clients without a corresponding increase in server-side processing.

In summary, NFS's use of iterative navigation for file name resolution is a design choice that supports statelessness, simplicity, client-side flexibility, fault tolerance, symbolic link resolution, distributed environment handling, performance optimization, and scalability. These characteristics are essential for a distributed file system that aims to provide a robust and efficient service in a networked environment.

### 13.6
Discuss the shortcomings of the original Internet naming scheme, in which all host names and addresses were held in a single central master file.  
*Page 592*
```
### 13.6 Discuss the shortcomings of the original Internet naming scheme, in which all host names and addresses were held in a single central master file.

The original Internet naming scheme, which relied on a single central master file to hold all host names and addresses, had several significant shortcomings that became increasingly problematic as the Internet grew in size and complexity. These shortcomings include:

1. **Scalability Issues**: The central master file approach was not scalable. As the number of hosts on the Internet expanded, the file grew larger, making it increasingly difficult to manage and distribute. The time required to update and propagate changes to all users became impractical, and the system could not efficiently handle the growing demand for name resolution services.

2. **Single Point of Failure**: The central master file represented a single point of failure. If the server hosting the file experienced downtime or technical issues, the entire system of name resolution could be compromised, potentially disrupting Internet connectivity for a vast number of users and services.

3. **Administrative Overhead**: Centralized management of the master file required significant administrative effort. As more hosts were added, the administrative burden of maintaining the file, ensuring its accuracy, and handling updates increased correspondingly.

4. **Lack of Autonomy**: Organizations lacked the autonomy to manage their own naming information. Changes had to be communicated to the central authority managing the master file, which would then have to update the file accordingly. This process was cumbersome and slow, hindering the ability of organizations to respond quickly to changes in their network infrastructure.

5. **Inconsistency and Propagation Delays**: The process of updating the master file and distributing it to all users could introduce delays, during which different users might have different versions of the file. This inconsistency could lead to resolution errors, where a domain name might not resolve to the correct IP address.

6. **Security Risks**: Having a single repository for all host names and addresses posed a security risk. If the master file were compromised, the attacker could potentially redirect traffic or take down websites by altering the DNS records.

7. **Limited Redundancy**: The central master file system provided limited options for redundancy. In the event of a server failure or data corruption, there were no robust mechanisms in place to ensure continued availability of the naming service.

8. **Resource Constraints**: The central server responsible for the master file could become a bottleneck, as it had to handle all requests for name resolution. This could lead to performance issues, with slow response times for DNS queries, especially during peak usage periods.

To address these and other issues, the Domain Name System (DNS) was developed. DNS introduced a distributed and hierarchical approach to name resolution, which allowed for scalability, redundancy, improved performance, and delegated administration, overcoming many of the limitations of the original naming scheme.

### 13.7
Investigate your local configuration of DNS domains and servers. You may find a program such as `dig` or `nslookup` installed, which enables you to carry out individual name server queries.  
*Page 594*
```
### 13.7 Investigate your local configuration of DNS domains and servers.

To investigate the local configuration of DNS domains and servers on a computer system, you can use various command-line tools that query DNS servers and fetch information about domain names, IP addresses, and associated records. Two commonly used tools for this purpose are `dig` (Domain Information Groper) and `nslookup`.

#### Using `dig`:

`dig` is a versatile DNS lookup utility available on most Unix-based systems, including Linux and macOS. It provides detailed information about DNS records and is useful for troubleshooting DNS problems.

To use `dig`, you can simply type `dig` followed by the domain name you want to query. For example:

```bash
dig example.com
```

This command will provide a wealth of information, including the domain's A record (the IP address), the authoritative name servers, the time-to-live (TTL) values, and more.

You can also specify the type of DNS record you're interested in. For instance, to get the mail exchange (MX) records for a domain, you would use:

```bash
dig example.com MX
```

To find out which DNS server is being used for the query, you can use the `+trace` option, which shows the path taken to resolve the domain name:

```bash
dig example.com +trace
```

#### Using `nslookup`:

`nslookup` is another tool used for querying DNS servers to obtain domain name or IP address mapping, as well as other DNS records. It is available on Unix-based systems and also on Windows.

To use `nslookup`, you can simply type `nslookup` followed by the domain name:

```bash
nslookup example.com
```

This command will return the A record for `example.com`. If you want to find the NS (name server) records, you can type:

```bash
nslookup -type=NS example.com
```

For MX records, you would use:

```bash
nslookup -type=MX example.com
```

`nslookup` also has an interactive mode, which you can enter by typing `nslookup` without any arguments. In this mode, you can set various options and perform multiple queries.

#### Local DNS Configuration:

On most systems, the local DNS configuration is stored in the file `/etc/resolv.conf`. This file contains the IP addresses of the DNS servers that the system uses for name resolution. You can view the contents of this file with a text editor or by using the `cat` command:

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

The output will typically include lines starting with `nameserver`, followed by the IP addresses of the DNS servers.

By using these tools and examining the local DNS configuration, you can gain a detailed understanding of how DNS queries are resolved on your system, which DNS servers are being used, and how different types of DNS records are configured for domains.

### 13.8
Why do DNS root servers hold entries for two-level names such as `yahoo.com` and `purdue.edu`, rather than one-level names such as `edu` and `com`?  
*Page 595*
```
### 13.8 Why do DNS root servers hold entries for two-level names such as `yahoo.com` and `purdue.edu`, rather than one-level names such as `edu` and `com`?

DNS root servers are a critical part of the Domain Name System (DNS), which is the protocol responsible for translating human-friendly domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. The DNS hierarchy is designed as a distributed database to ensure scalability, reliability, and efficient resolution of domain names.

The root servers sit at the top of the DNS hierarchy and primarily provide the authoritative reference to the Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers, which include generic TLDs (gTLDs) like `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, and country code TLDs (ccTLDs) like `.uk`, `.fr`, `.ca`, etc. These TLD servers, in turn, hold information about the domains that are registered under them.

The reason root servers hold entries for two-level domain names, such as `yahoo.com` or `purdue.edu`, rather than just the TLDs like `.com` or `.edu`, is due to a process called delegation. In the DNS hierarchy, the management of domains is delegated down the tree from the root servers to the TLD servers, and then further to second-level domains (SLDs), which are the readable names we are familiar with, like `yahoo` or `purdue`.

Here are the key reasons for this delegation approach:

1. **Scalability**: If root servers were to hold records for every domain at every level, they would be overwhelmed with the sheer volume of data to store and manage. By delegating the responsibility for second-level domains to TLD servers, the root servers are only tasked with directing traffic to these TLD servers, which then handle the more granular details. This distribution of data ensures that the system can scale as more domains are added to the internet.

2. **Load Distribution**: By delegating the responsibility for maintaining domain records to TLD servers, the load on the root servers is significantly reduced. This distribution of queries across multiple servers prevents any single point from becoming a bottleneck, enhancing the overall performance and stability of the DNS infrastructure.

3. **Administrative Autonomy**: Different organizations manage different TLDs, and they have the autonomy to manage the second-level domains under their TLD. For example, VeriSign manages `.com`, and Educause manages `.edu`. This allows for specialized management and policies that are tailored to the needs of each TLD.

4. **Efficiency in Resolution**: When a DNS resolver queries a root server for a domain like `example.com`, the root server doesn't provide the IP address for `example.com`. Instead, it refers the resolver to the `.com` TLD server. The TLD server then either provides the IP address for `example.com` or refers the resolver to another authoritative server that has the information. This referral system ensures that DNS queries are resolved efficiently by directing them to the server that has the specific information needed.

5. **Redundancy and Reliability**: The DNS is designed to be a redundant system. By having multiple root servers and TLD servers, the system ensures that if one server is unavailable, others can take over, providing continuous availability of DNS services.

In summary, DNS root servers hold entries for TLDs and delegate the management of second-level domains to TLD servers to ensure scalability, efficient load distribution, administrative autonomy, efficient resolution of queries, and redundancy for reliability. This hierarchical structure is fundamental to the design and functionality of the DNS, allowing it to serve the vast and ever-growing number of domain names on the internet.

### 13.9 Which are the original top-level organizational domains in use across the Internet?

The original top-level organizational domains, also known as generic top-level domains (gTLDs), were established in the 1980s as part of the Domain Name System (DNS) to help organize and identify domains on the Internet. These domains are part of the global hierarchy of domain names and serve as the highest level of domain names in the DNS structure.

The original top-level organizational domains in use across the Internet were:

- **.com**: This domain was intended for commercial entities, businesses, and companies. It is the most widely used gTLD and has become synonymous with the commercial aspect of the Internet.

- **.edu**: This domain was designated for educational institutions, primarily in the United States. Colleges, universities, and other educational organizations use this domain.

- **.gov**: This domain was reserved for government entities within the United States. It includes federal, state, and local government agencies.

- **.mil**: This domain was created for the United States military and its branches. It is used by various military organizations and establishments.

- **.net**: Originally intended for network infrastructure providers, such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and other networking organizations, this domain has since been opened up for general use.

- **.org**: This domain was intended for non-commercial organizations, including non-profits, charities, and cultural institutions. Like .net, it is now open for general use.

- **.int**: This lesser-known domain was used for organizations established by international treaties or other international organizations.

These original gTLDs were part of a limited set of domain options available to entities wishing to establish an online presence. Over time, the number of gTLDs has expanded significantly to include a wide variety of new and more descriptive options, allowing for greater flexibility and specificity in domain names. However, the original gTLDs still play a significant role on the Internet and are highly sought after due to their recognition and legacy status.

*Page 597*
```
### 13.10 Why might a DNS client choose recursive navigation rather than iterative navigation? What is the relevance of the recursive navigation option to concurrency within a name server?

In the context of DNS resolution, a client can choose between two types of navigation: recursive and iterative. Each has its own advantages and implications for the operation of the name servers involved.

#### Recursive Navigation

In recursive navigation, when a DNS client (resolver) needs to resolve a domain name to an IP address, it sends a query to a DNS server and expects that server to handle the entire resolution process. If the server does not have the answer in its cache, it will query other servers on behalf of the client. This process continues until the server either finds the answer or determines that the domain name cannot be resolved. The final result is then sent back to the client.

**Advantages of Recursive Navigation:**

1. **Simplicity for the Client:** The client offloads the resolution process to the server, which simplifies the client's task. The client sends one query and waits for one response, without needing to handle multiple interactions with different servers.

2. **Reduced Network Traffic:** Since the client only communicates with one server, the number of messages sent over the network is reduced compared to iterative navigation, where the client might have to communicate with multiple servers.

3. **Caching Efficiency:** The recursive server can cache the results of queries it performs on behalf of clients. Subsequent queries for the same domain can be answered more quickly from the cache, benefiting all clients that use that server.

4. **Error Handling:** The recursive server can handle errors and follow different paths in the DNS hierarchy to find the answer, abstracting this complexity away from the client.

**Relevance to Concurrency:**

The use of recursive navigation has implications for concurrency within a name server:

1. **Resource Utilization:** Recursive queries can tie up resources on the server because the server must maintain state information for each active recursive resolution process. This can limit the server's ability to handle concurrent requests, especially under high load.

2. **Potential for Overload:** If too many recursive queries are being processed simultaneously, the server may become overloaded, leading to increased response times or even service outages.

3. **Scalability Challenges:** To manage concurrency effectively, recursive servers need to be designed with scalability in mind. This includes implementing efficient caching mechanisms, load balancing, and possibly rate limiting to prevent abuse.

4. **Vulnerability to DDoS Attacks:** Recursive servers can be more vulnerable to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, as attackers can exploit the server's willingness to perform recursive lookups to amplify the traffic directed at a target.

In summary, a DNS client might choose recursive navigation for its simplicity and reduced network traffic, while also benefiting from the caching efficiency of the recursive server. However, the use of recursive navigation places more demand on the server's resources and requires careful management of concurrency to ensure the server remains responsive and scalable.

```
### 13.11 A DNS client is called a resolver. What is its role?

In the context of the Domain Name System (DNS), a client that initiates requests to resolve domain names to IP addresses is known as a resolver. The resolver's primary role is to act as an intermediary between the user or client application and the DNS infrastructure. Here is an in-depth look at the functions and operations of a DNS resolver:

1. **Translation of Names to IP Addresses**: The most fundamental role of the resolver is to translate human-readable domain names (like `www.example.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`). This process is essential because while domain names are easy for humans to remember, computers and networking equipment require numerical IP addresses to route traffic on the internet.

2. **Query Initiation**: When a user enters a domain name into a web browser or when an application needs to access a resource on the internet, the resolver initiates a DNS query. It constructs a request based on the domain name and sends it to a DNS server that can provide the corresponding IP address.

3. **Recursive and Iterative Queries**: Resolvers can perform two types of queries: recursive and iterative. In a recursive query, the resolver asks a DNS server to provide the final answer. The server will perform all the necessary lookups on behalf of the resolver and return the final IP address. In an iterative query, the resolver receives information on how to continue the search from each DNS server it queries, but it must perform the follow-up queries itself until it finds the answer.

4. **Caching**: To improve efficiency and reduce DNS traffic, resolvers cache the results of previous lookups. When a resolver receives a DNS response, it stores the mapping of the domain name to the IP address for a certain period, known as the Time To Live (TTL). Subsequent requests for the same domain name can be answered from the cache if the TTL has not expired, which speeds up the resolution process and reduces the load on DNS servers.

5. **Handling DNS Records**: Besides the basic A records (which map hostnames to IPv4 addresses) and AAAA records (which map hostnames to IPv6 addresses), resolvers also handle other types of DNS records. For example, MX records for mail servers, NS records for name server information, CNAME records for canonical names, and more.

6. **Error Handling**: If a resolver cannot find an IP address for a domain name (because the domain does not exist or due to a network error), it must handle this situation gracefully. It may return an error message to the client application or attempt alternative resolution strategies, such as trying a different DNS server.

7. **Security Functions**: Modern resolvers also implement security functions to protect against DNS-related attacks. For instance, they may support DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to verify the authenticity of DNS responses and prevent DNS spoofing attacks.

8. **Local and Network Resolvers**: Resolvers can be local (running on the same machine as the client application) or network-based (provided by an ISP or a third-party DNS service). Local resolvers typically handle caching and initial query generation, while network resolvers perform the bulk of the resolution work.

In summary, the DNS resolver plays a critical role in the DNS ecosystem, bridging the gap between human-friendly domain names and the IP addresses required for network routing. It ensures that internet users and applications can reliably and efficiently access resources using domain names.

The GNS does not guarantee that all copies of entries in the naming database are up-to-date. How are clients of the GNS likely to become aware that they have been given an out-of-date entry? Under what circumstances might it be harmful?

```
### 13.12 The GNS does not guarantee that all copies of entries in the naming database are up-to-date. How are clients of the GNS likely to become aware that they have been given an out-of-date entry? Under what circumstances might it be harmful?

In the context of the Global Name Service (GNS), the issue of out-of-date entries arises due to the system's reliance on caching and the asynchronous nature of updates across a distributed database. The GNS is designed to handle a vast number of names and to serve a large number of administrative organizations, which necessitates a scalable and fault-tolerant approach to name resolution. To achieve this, GNS employs replication of directory information across multiple servers and caching of this information at client sites to improve performance and availability.

Clients of the GNS are likely to become aware that they have been given an out-of-date entry in several ways:

1. **Direct Observation**: A client may attempt to use the information obtained from the GNS, such as an IP address or a file location, and find that the resource is not available or does not behave as expected. This discrepancy would suggest that the entry is outdated.

2. **Time-to-Live (TTL) Expiry**: Each entry in the GNS typically has an associated TTL, which indicates how long the entry should be considered valid. Clients and intermediate resolvers can use this TTL to determine when to refresh an entry. If a client or resolver notices that the TTL has expired, it may proactively query the GNS for an updated entry.

3. **Versioning and Timestamps**: Some implementations of naming services include version numbers or timestamps with each entry. Clients can use this information to detect if an entry has been superseded by a newer version.

4. **Error Messages**: In some cases, the system or application trying to use the outdated information may return an error message indicating that the resource is not available or that the information is incorrect.

5. **Manual Checks**: Users or system administrators may periodically check the validity of critical entries by comparing them against authoritative sources or by manual verification.

Out-of-date entries can be harmful in various circumstances, particularly when the correctness and timeliness of the information are critical for system operations. Some scenarios where outdated entries might cause harm include:

- **Security**: Outdated entries could redirect users to malicious sites or services, leading to potential security breaches. For example, if a domain name points to an old IP address that has been reassigned to a different entity, users could be exposed to phishing attacks or data interception.

- **Service Availability**: If a service has moved to a new location and the GNS still provides the old address, clients will be unable to access the service, leading to downtime and potential loss of business or productivity.

- **Data Integrity**: In distributed systems, outdated information about the location of data resources could lead to data being written to incorrect locations, resulting in data loss or corruption.

- **System Stability**: In a distributed computing environment, outdated information about the configuration or status of system components could lead to incorrect decisions that affect the stability of the system.

To mitigate the risks associated with out-of-date entries, GNS and similar systems implement strategies such as reducing the TTL for volatile entries, increasing the frequency of updates, and using mechanisms to detect and correct inconsistencies. However, the trade-off between data freshness and system performance must be carefully managed to ensure that the name service remains efficient and scalable while minimizing the risk of serving stale data.

### 13.13 Discuss the potential advantages and drawbacks of the use of an X.500 directory service in place of the DNS and the Internet mail delivery programs. Sketch the design of a mail delivery system for an internetwork in which all mail users and mail hosts are registered in an X.500 database.

#### Advantages of Using X.500 over DNS and Internet Mail Delivery Programs

1. **Rich Attribute Set**: X.500 directory services can store a wide variety of attributes for each entry, not just names and IP addresses. This allows for more detailed information about users and resources, such as organizational affiliation, telephone numbers, physical addresses, and even personal attributes like job roles or preferences.

2. **Descriptive Queries**: X.500 supports complex queries based on attributes, not just names. This means users can search for resources or other users based on a variety of criteria, which is not possible with DNS.

3. **Global Directory**: X.500 is designed to be a global directory service, which can be advantageous for large organizations or federations of organizations that need to share directory information in a standardized way.

4. **Security and Access Control**: X.500 includes mechanisms for authentication and access control, allowing for secure and controlled access to directory information.

5. **Object Classes and Inheritance**: X.500's use of object classes and inheritance allows for a structured and extensible schema for directory information, which can be tailored to the specific needs of an organization.

6. **Integration with Other Services**: Because X.500 can store a variety of attributes, it can be integrated with other services beyond mail, such as authentication services or network resource directories.

#### Drawbacks of Using X.500 over DNS and Internet Mail Delivery Programs

1. **Complexity**: X.500 is more complex than DNS, both in terms of its protocol and the structure of the directory information. This can make it more difficult to implement and manage.

2. **Performance**: The richness of the X.500 directory service can lead to performance issues, especially if the directory is large and queries are complex.

3. **Adoption**: DNS is widely adopted and understood, whereas X.500 is less commonly used for Internet services. This can lead to compatibility issues and a steeper learning curve.

4. **LDAP as an Alternative**: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) has emerged as a more popular alternative to X.500 for many directory service applications, due to its simplicity and ease of use over TCP/IP.

#### Sketch of a Mail Delivery System Using X.500

In a mail delivery system where all mail users and hosts are registered in an X.500 database, the following components would be involved:

1. **Directory User Agents (DUAs)**: Client applications that allow users to query the X.500 directory for mail-related attributes of users, such as their email addresses.

2. **Directory Service Agents (DSAs)**: Servers that hold the X.500 directory information and respond to queries from DUAs.

3. **Mail User Agents (MUAs)**: Email clients that users interact with to compose, send, and receive email.

4. **Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs)**: Servers responsible for transferring email from the sender's MUA to the recipient's MUA.

In this system, when a user composes an email, the MUA queries the X.500 directory via a DUA to resolve the recipient's email address and other relevant attributes. The MUA then sends the email to an MTA, which uses the directory information to route the email to the recipient's MTA and eventually to their MUA.

The X.500 directory would need to be structured to efficiently handle mail-related queries, with object classes designed for mail users and mail hosts. Each user entry in the directory would include attributes for their email addresses, preferred MTAs, and possibly mail filtering preferences. Each mail host entry would include attributes for domain names, supported mail protocols, and routing information.

The system would need to ensure that the directory is kept up to date with current email addresses and routing information to ensure reliable mail delivery. It would also need to implement security measures to protect sensitive directory information and authenticate users when they access the directory.

### 13.14 What features does the X.500 directory service provide over a conventional name service?

The X.500 directory service, as an enhancement over conventional name services, offers a comprehensive and flexible framework for representing and querying a wide variety of information about entities within a distributed network. Here are some of the key features that X.500 provides over a conventional name service:

1. **Rich Attribute-Based Entries**: Unlike conventional name services that typically map names to a limited set of attributes (usually addresses), X.500 entries can contain a rich set of attributes for each object. These attributes can include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and many other types of information.

2. **Hierarchical Structure**: X.500 organizes entries in a Directory Information Tree (DIT), which reflects real-world organizational or geographical hierarchies. This hierarchical structure allows for a natural organization of entries and can mirror the structure of the entities it represents, such as businesses, governments, and educational institutions.

3. **Global Scope and Scalability**: X.500 is designed to be a global directory service that can scale to accommodate a vast number of entries. It is intended to support a single, integrated Directory Information Base (DIB) that spans multiple organizations and can be distributed across numerous Directory Service Agents (DSAs).

4. **Sophisticated Querying**: X.500 supports complex queries using filters that can match entries based on any combination of attributes. This allows for more nuanced searches than simple name lookups, such as finding all users in a particular department with a specific role.

5. **Object Classes and Inheritance**: X.500 uses an object-oriented approach where entries are classified into object classes, which define sets of mandatory and optional attributes. Object classes can inherit attributes from other classes, allowing for a structured and extensible schema.

6. **Distinguished Names (DNs)**: Each entry in X.500 has a unique Distinguished Name, which is a sequence of relative distinguished names (RDNs) that provides a path to the entry in the DIT. This ensures that each entry can be uniquely identified and accessed.

7. **Security and Access Control**: X.500 includes mechanisms for authentication and access control, allowing directory administrators to control who can access or modify the information in the directory.

8. **Replication and Caching**: To enhance performance and availability, X.500 supports replication of directory information across multiple DSAs. Caching mechanisms are also employed to reduce lookup times and network traffic.

9. **Extensibility**: X.500 is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new attribute types and object classes as needed. This ensures that the directory can evolve to meet changing requirements.

10. **Standards-Based**: As an ITU and ISO standard, X.500 provides a well-defined protocol for directory services, which promotes interoperability between different systems and vendors.

11. **Integration with Other Services**: X.500 can be integrated with other network services, such as email and authentication services, providing a centralized repository for user and resource information.

12. **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)**: Although not a feature of X.500 itself, LDAP is a protocol that provides a simpler way to access X.500 directories. LDAP has become a popular alternative to the more complex X.500 access protocols, especially for internet-based applications.

In summary, X.500 directory service offers a robust and versatile framework for storing and retrieving detailed information about a wide array of entities in a distributed network, providing capabilities that go well beyond those of conventional name services.

# Summary answers

Based on the transcribed notes from Chapter 13 on Name Services, here are the answers to the exercises:
```

### 13.1
The advantages of the uniformity of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) include the ability to identify resources on the Web and other Internet resources such as electronic mailboxes in a coherent way. This uniformity allows common software like browsers to process a wide variety of resource identifiers, facilitating the introduction of new types of identifiers and the use of existing identifiers in new contexts without disrupting existing usage.

### 13.2
The problem associated with name services in a distributed system is the difficulty in managing a large number of names, ensuring high availability, fault isolation, and tolerance of mistrust. This can be solved by using a hierarchical partitioning of the naming database, replication of naming data to increase performance and availability, and caching to reduce lookup times and network traffic.

### 13.3
A name space is important for a particular name service because it defines the collection of all valid names recognized by the service, which the service will attempt to look up. The advantage of a hierarchic name space is that it makes large name spaces more manageable by resolving each part of a hierarchic name relative to a separate context, allowing the same name to be used with different meanings in different contexts.

### 13.4
The heterogeneity of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) name space allows for the embedding of heterogeneous name spaces within it. In DCE, a cell is a context like a directory, and a junction is a point where a different name space can be mounted. For example, the name /.../dcs.qmul.ac.uk/principals/Jean.Dollimore contains a cell (/.../dcs.qmul.ac.uk) and a junction (principals), allowing for the resolution of names within different contexts.

### 13.5
NFS employs iterative navigation in the resolution of a file name because the file service may encounter a symbolic link when resolving a name, which must be interpreted in the client’s file system name space. This requires the client to determine which server the symbolic link points to, as only the client knows its mount points.

### 13.6
The shortcomings of the original Internet naming scheme, which used a single central master file for all host names and addresses, included its inability to scale to large numbers of computers, the desire of local organizations to administer their own naming systems, and the need for a general name service rather than one that only serves for looking up computer addresses.

### 13.7
To investigate your local configuration of DNS domains and servers, you can use tools like `dig` or `nslookup` to carry out individual name server queries. These tools allow you to explore the DNS records associated with domain names and can provide information about the DNS servers responsible for a domain.

### 13.8
DNS root servers hold entries for two-level names such as `yahoo.com` and `purdue.edu` rather than one-level names like `edu` and `com` to reduce the number of navigation steps required to resolve domain names. This allows for more efficient resolution of names and reduces the load on root servers.

### 13.9
The original top-level organizational domains in use across the Internet included com, edu, gov, mil, net, org, and int. These domains were established to categorize and organize the growing number of registered domain names on the Internet.

### 13.10
A DNS client might choose recursive navigation rather than iterative navigation because it simplifies the client's task by offloading the resolution process to the DNS server. The recursive navigation option is relevant to concurrency within a name server because it may tie up server threads, potentially delaying other requests.

### 13.11
A DNS client is called a resolver, and its role is to translate domain names into IP addresses. The resolver sends queries to DNS servers and processes the responses to obtain the IP addresses associated with domain names, which are then used by applications to establish network connections.

### 13.12
Clients of the Global Name Service (GNS) are likely to become aware that they have been given an out-of-date entry when they attempt to use the entry and find that it does not work as expected. This might be harmful under circumstances where timely and accurate information is critical, such as in financial transactions or emergency services.

### 13.13
The potential advantages of using an X.500 directory service in place of the DNS and Internet mail delivery programs include the ability to store a wider range of attributes and to perform more complex queries based on those attributes. A mail delivery system design for an internetwork using X.500 would involve registering all mail users and hosts in the X.500 database, allowing for more flexible and powerful mail routing and delivery options.

### 13.14
The X.500 directory service provides features over a conventional name service such as a structured directory information tree, the ability to store a wide range of attributes, and support for complex queries based on those attributes. It also supports access control, allowing for the restriction of access to certain parts of the directory.
